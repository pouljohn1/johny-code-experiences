  script={`Hi! In this lesson, we’ll answer a simple question: what is Nuxt, and why would you use it?

We’ll compare it to plain Vue, explore core features like file-based routing and rendering modes, and build a basic mental model.

Read on, and you’ll see where Nuxt fits in your projects.`} />

Nuxt is a **framework built on top of Vue** that helps you build modern web applications with sensible defaults, strong conventions, and powerful features like server‑side rendering.

## Learning goals

After this chapter, you should be able to:

- Explain **what Nuxt is** in one or two sentences
- Describe how Nuxt relates to **Vue**
- List the main **benefits** of using Nuxt
- Understand the idea of **rendering modes** at a high level

## What is Nuxt?

Nuxt is often described as a **meta‑framework** for Vue. In simpler terms:

> **Nuxt = Vue + routing + data‑fetching + rendering + conventions + tooling**

With plain Vue, you usually need to:

- Set up **routing** manually (e.g. with Vue Router)
- Decide how to do **server‑side rendering** (SSR) or pre‑rendering
- Configure **webpack/Vite**, code splitting, and performance tweaks
- Organize folders and files by yourself

Nuxt takes care of these for you by providing:

- **File‑based routing** – pages are auto‑generated from the `pages/` folder
- Built‑in **SSR**, **static site generation** (SSG), and **SPA** modes
- A standard **project structure** that scales
- Helpful **conventions** and **defaults** that keep your app organized

## How Nuxt relates to Vue

Nuxt uses **Vue components** under the hood. If you know Vue, you already know a lot of Nuxt.

Key relationships:

- Nuxt apps are made of **Vue single‑file components** (`.vue` files)
- You use the **Composition API** or **Options API** like in normal Vue
- Nuxt adds extra features like `useRoute`, `useAsyncData`, and `useState`

You can think of Nuxt as:

> **“Vue, plus batteries included.”**

### Basic mental model

A simple way to think about Nuxt:

1. You create pages in the `pages/` directory.
2. Nuxt automatically turns those files into **routes**.
3. Your app renders on the **server**, **client**, or both (depending on your config).
4. Nuxt handles **bundling**, **routing**, and **data fetching hooks** so you can focus on your app.

## Why use Nuxt instead of plain Vue?

### 1. Productivity and conventions

Nuxt gives you **conventions over configuration**:

- Put page components in `pages/` → you get routes
- Put reusable components in `components/` → Nuxt can auto‑import them
- Put shared logic in `composables/` → easy to reuse across your app

This reduces “decision fatigue” so you can focus on features.

### 2. Rendering modes (high level)

Nuxt offers different **rendering strategies** out of the box:

- **Server‑Side Rendering (SSR)**: pages are rendered on the server for each request
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: pages are pre‑rendered at build time
- **Single‑Page Application (SPA)**: rendering happens mostly in the browser

You can often use sensible defaults without fully understanding every detail yet. We’ll revisit this in more depth later.

### 3. Performance and SEO

Because Nuxt can render pages on the server or pre‑render them, you get:

- **Faster first page load** (users see content sooner)
- Better **SEO** (search engines can easily read the HTML)
- Built‑in **code splitting** and **lazy loading** handled by the framework

### 4. Ecosystem and modules

Nuxt has an ecosystem of **modules** that plug into your app with minimal setup, for example:

- Analytics
- Authentication helpers
- Content systems (like documentation/blog engines)
- UI libraries integration

You install and configure a module, and Nuxt hooks it into the right places automatically.

## Nuxt vs other tools (very briefly)

You might have heard of frameworks like **Next.js**, **SvelteKit**, or **Remix**. Nuxt plays a similar role in the **Vue world**:

- If you like Vue’s template syntax and reactivity, Nuxt lets you build **full apps** with it
- It focuses on developer experience, performance, and clear conventions

You don’t need to know these other tools to learn Nuxt; this is just to give you context.

## A minimal Nuxt mental picture

Imagine a simple Nuxt app:

- `pages/index.vue` → your home page route `/`
- `pages/about.vue` → your about page route `/about`
- `components/NavBar.vue` → a shared nav bar used on both pages
- `app.vue` → the root component that wraps everything

Nuxt wires this all up into a running application with routing, dev server, and bundling **without you configuring Vite or Vue Router manually**.

## Common misconceptions

### “Nuxt is a different framework than Vue”

Not quite. Nuxt is built **on top of Vue**. You still write Vue components and use Vue features. Nuxt extends Vue, it doesn’t replace it.

### “I must understand every rendering mode before starting”

You don’t. You can start with the **default configuration** and treat Nuxt like a Vue app with a nicer router and structure. As you progress, you’ll learn when to use SSR or SSG.

### “Nuxt is only for big enterprise apps”

Nuxt also works great for:

- Personal blogs and portfolios
- Small dashboards
- Prototypes

You can start small and grow your app over time.

## Quick exercise

Take a moment to write your own one‑sentence answer to:

> “What is Nuxt, and why might I use it instead of plain Vue?”

Try to mention **Vue**, **routing**, and **rendering**.
