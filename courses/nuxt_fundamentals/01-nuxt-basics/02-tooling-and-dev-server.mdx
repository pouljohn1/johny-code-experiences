In this chapter you’ll set up your first Nuxt project, run the development server, and explore the main commands you’ll use every day.

## Learning goals

You will learn how to:

- Install the necessary **tools** (Node, package manager)
- **Create** a new Nuxt app using the official starter
- Run the **development server** and open your app in the browser
- Understand basic **scripts** like `dev`, `build`, and `preview`

## Requirements

Make sure you have installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS, e.g. 18+)
- A **package manager** (`npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`)

You can check your versions with:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If these commands fail, install Node from the official website before continuing.

## Creating a new Nuxt project

The recommended way to start a new Nuxt project is using the official starter template.

From a terminal, in the folder where you want your project to live, run:

```bash
npx nuxi init my-nuxt-app
```

Explanation:

- `npx` runs a package without installing it globally
- `nuxi` is the Nuxt CLI tool
- `init` tells it to create a new project
- `my-nuxt-app` is your new project folder name (you can choose another)

After the command finishes:

```bash
cd my-nuxt-app
npm install
```

(or use `yarn` / `pnpm` instead of `npm install` if you prefer.)

This installs all Nuxt dependencies.

## Running the dev server

Once dependencies are installed, start the dev server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see output similar to:

```text
Nuxt 3 ready in Xs

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You should see the default Nuxt starter page.

### Hot module replacement (HMR)

Nuxt uses **Vite** (by default) under the hood, which supports **hot module replacement**:

- When you change a `.vue` file and save it
- The browser updates the changed part **without a full page reload**

Try this:

1. Open `app.vue` or `pages/index.vue` in your editor.
2. Change some visible text.
3. Save the file.
4. Watch the browser update almost instantly.

This quick feedback loop is a big part of Nuxt’s developer experience.

## Common scripts in `package.json`

Open your project’s `package.json`. You’ll see scripts similar to:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nuxt dev",
  "build": "nuxt build",
  "preview": "nuxt preview",
  "start": "nuxt start"
}
```

What they do:

- `npm run dev` → Runs the **development server** with hot reload
- `npm run build` → Builds your app for **production**
- `npm run preview` → Serves the **built** app locally to test the production build
- `npm run start` → Starts a production server (depending on your deployment setup)

For now, you’ll mostly use `npm run dev`.

## Exploring the starter page

Look inside your project and find:

- `app.vue`
- `pages/index.vue`

Open them and see how the starter page is structured. This is a regular Vue single‑file component with `<template>`, `<script setup>`, and `<style>` sections.

Try changing the title text in `pages/index.vue` and see it update in the browser.

## Where to look when something breaks

When you see a blank page or an error:

1. **Check the terminal** where `npm run dev` is running
   - Nuxt will log compilation errors or missing files
2. **Open the browser dev tools** (F12 or right‑click → Inspect)
   - Check the **Console** tab for JavaScript errors
3. Fix the issue, **save the file**, and watch Nuxt reload

Most beginner issues are small things like:

- Typos in file or folder names (case‑sensitive paths)
- Invalid Vue template syntax
- Missing imports

## Quick experiment

Try these small experiments in your new Nuxt app:

1. In `pages/index.vue`, add a new piece of text, like `Hello from Nuxt!`.
2. Add a simple style rule to change the background color.
3. Stop the dev server with `Ctrl + C` (or `Cmd + C` on macOS), then run `npm run dev` again.

This helps you see the basic development cycle: **edit → save → see changes → repeat**.
