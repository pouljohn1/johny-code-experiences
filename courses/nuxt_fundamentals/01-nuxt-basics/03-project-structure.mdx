A big advantage of Nuxt is its **opinionated project structure**. Files live in specific places, and Nuxt uses those locations to wire up routing, components, and shared logic.

## Learning goals

After this chapter, you should be able to:

- Recognize the **key folders** in a Nuxt project
- Understand what `app.vue` and `nuxt.config` do at a high level
- Know where to put **pages**, **components**, and **composables**
- Explain the basics of **file‑based routing**

## High‑level layout of a Nuxt project

In a typical Nuxt 3 project, you’ll see something like:

```text
my-nuxt-app/
  ├─ node_modules/
  ├─ public/
  ├─ .nuxt/
  ├─ components/
  ├─ composables/
  ├─ layouts/
  ├─ pages/
  ├─ plugins/
  ├─ app.vue
  ├─ nuxt.config.ts
  ├─ package.json
  └─ tsconfig.json (optional)
```

Let’s walk through the important ones for beginners.

## `app.vue` – the root component

`app.vue` is the **root Vue component** of your Nuxt app. It wraps all your pages.

- Think of it as the place to put things that **appear on every page**
- Common examples: global navigation, footer, app‑wide layout wrappers

A minimal example might look like:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <header>
      <h1>My Nuxt App</h1>
    </header>

    <NuxtPage />
  </div>
</template>
```

- `<NuxtPage />` is a special Nuxt component that renders the **current page** based on the route.

Later, when you learn about **layouts**, you’ll see more advanced patterns, but this is enough for now.

## `pages/` – file‑based routing

The `pages/` folder is where you define your **routes**. Nuxt automatically turns files here into routes.

Examples:

```text
pages/
  index.vue       →  /
  about.vue       →  /about
  blog/index.vue  →  /blog
  blog/[id].vue   →  /blog/:id
```

You don’t need to manually configure a router. Just create a `.vue` file in `pages/`, and Nuxt handles the rest.

### `pages/index.vue`

This is usually your **home page**. Try editing it:

```vue
<template>
  <main>
    <h2>Welcome to my Nuxt app</h2>
    <p>This is the home page.</p>
  </main>
</template>
```

Refresh `http://localhost:3000/` and you’ll see your changes.

## `components/` – reusable building blocks

The `components/` folder is where you place **reusable Vue components** that are not routes by themselves.

Examples:

```text
components/
  NavBar.vue
  AppFooter.vue
  TodoItem.vue
```

Nuxt can **auto‑import** components from this folder, which means:

- You can use `<NavBar />` in your templates without manually importing it in the `<script>` section (in many cases).

You’ll dive deeper into components in a later module; for now, remember this is where small reusable pieces live.

## `layouts/` – shared page wrappers (preview)

`layouts/` is for **page layouts** that wrap page content.

- You might have a `default.vue` layout for most pages
- And maybe an `auth.vue` layout for login/register pages

A very simple default layout could look like:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <header>My Site</header>
    <main>
      <slot />
    </main>
  </div>
</template>
```

You then tell a page to use a specific layout. We’ll revisit this later; just know that `layouts/` is about shared page wrappers.

## `composables/` – shared logic

The `composables/` folder is meant for **reusable logic functions** using Vue’s **Composition API**.

You’ll typically create functions like:

```text
composables/
  useCounter.ts
  useUser.ts
```

Example `useCounter` composable:

```ts
// composables/useCounter.ts
import { ref } from 'vue'

export function useCounter() {
  const count = ref(0)

  const increment = () => {
    count.value++
  }

  return { count, increment }
}
```

In a component, you can then do:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { count, increment } = useCounter()
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">Clicked {{ count }} times</button>
</template>
```

Nuxt auto‑imports composables from this folder, so you can often call `useCounter()` directly.

You’ll leverage composables more when you learn about **state management**.

## `plugins/` – extending Nuxt (preview)

The `plugins/` folder is where you can register **plugins** that run before your app is created.

Examples:

- Adding a third‑party library globally
- Setting up a global HTTP client

At a beginner level, you can mostly **ignore `plugins/` for now**, but it’s useful to know it exists.

## `nuxt.config.ts` – configuration

`nuxt.config.ts` (or `.js`) is the **central configuration file** for your Nuxt app.

Typical things you configure here:

- Global CSS
- Modules to use (e.g. `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss`)
- Runtime settings

Example (simplified):

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  css: [
    '~/assets/css/main.css'
  ],
  modules: [
    '@nuxtjs/tailwindcss'
  ]
})
```

For now, you don’t need to customize much; the defaults are good.

## Other folders (briefly)

- `public/`
  - Static files served as‑is (e.g. `public/robots.txt` → `/robots.txt`)
- `.nuxt/`
  - Auto‑generated folder used by Nuxt internally (don’t edit it manually)
- `assets/`
  - Source assets like styles or images that are processed by the build system

## Putting it together: small example

Let’s build a minimal structure for a tiny app:

```text
pages/
  index.vue       → Home page
  about.vue       → About page
components/
  NavBar.vue      → Reusable navigation bar
app.vue           → Root that includes NavBar and NuxtPage
```

Example `components/NavBar.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <nav>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/about">About</a>
  </nav>
</template>
```

Example `app.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <NavBar />
    <NuxtPage />
  </div>
</template>
```

Now every page will show the nav bar at the top, and `<NuxtPage />` will render the correct page component.

## Common pitfalls

- **Misplaced files**: putting page components into `components/` instead of `pages/` (they won’t become routes).
- **Wrong file names**: routes depend on file names (`about.vue` → `/about`). A typo creates a route you don’t expect.
- **Editing `.nuxt/`**: this folder is generated; don’t change files there manually.

If something doesn’t show up as a route, double‑check the file path and name inside `pages/`.

## Practice

In your project, try the following:

1. Create `pages/about.vue` with some sample content. Visit `/about`.
2. Create `components/NavBar.vue` and include it in `app.vue`.
3. Create a simple composable `composables/useGreeting.ts` that returns a `greeting` string, and use it in `pages/index.vue`.

This exercise forces you to interact with the **most important parts** of the Nuxt structure.
