  script={`Welcome to Nuxt Basics.

In this module, you’ll learn what Nuxt is, how to spin up a new project, and how the default folder structure works.

By the end, you’ll feel comfortable navigating a Nuxt codebase and running the dev server.

Let’s jump in!`} />

This module gives you a solid foundation in Nuxt: what it is, how it runs, and how your files are organized.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Describe **what Nuxt is** and why you might choose it
- Set up and run a **Nuxt development environment**
- Use the **Nuxt dev server** and understand hot module replacement
- Navigate the **project structure** (folders and key files)
- Create basic **pages** and see how **file‑based routing** works

## How this module fits into the course

This is the **first module** of the Nuxt Fundamentals course. Everything else—components, hooks, and state management—relies on this knowledge.

- When we talk about **components**, we’ll assume you understand where `.vue` files live.
- When we use **hooks**, we’ll assume you know how a Nuxt app boots up.
- When we manage **state**, you’ll need to know where to place composables and configuration.

Understanding the basics now saves you confusion later.

## Chapters in this module

1. **Nuxt Overview** (`01-nuxt-overview.mdx`)
   - What Nuxt is
   - How it compares to Vue and other frameworks
   - Key features and mental model

2. **Tooling and Dev Server** (`02-tooling-and-dev-server.mdx`)
   - Creating a new Nuxt project
   - Using the CLI and dev server
   - Understanding hot reloads and debugging basics

3. **Project Structure** (`03-project-structure.mdx`)
   - The layout of a fresh Nuxt project
   - What each folder is for
   - How routing is driven by the file system

## Recommended pace

Take your time with this module:

- Expect around **1–2 hours** if you code along and experiment
- Don’t worry about memorizing every detail yet
- Focus on being able to **find things** in a Nuxt project and **run** the app

## Small project suggestion

As you work through this module, start a simple app that you’ll grow in later modules. For example:

- A **personal notes** app
- A **minimal blog**
- A **task list** or **habit tracker**

You’ll use this same project when learning components, hooks, and state.
