<AiVideo id="nuxt-fundamentals-course-intro" script={`Hi! Welcome to Nuxt Fundamentals.

In this course, you’ll learn what Nuxt is, how it builds on Vue, and how to work with components, hooks, and state.

We’ll also cover tooling, file structure, and best practices so you can build real projects with confidence.

Let’s dive in and start exploring Nuxt!`} />

Nuxt is a powerful framework built on top of Vue that helps you build modern, fast, and well‑structured web applications. This course will guide you from zero Nuxt knowledge to confidently building your first app.

## Who this course is for

This course is designed for **beginners to Nuxt** who already know basic web development:

* You can write basic **HTML** and understand tags and attributes
* You are comfortable with **CSS** selectors and simple layouts
* You know **JavaScript** fundamentals: variables, functions, arrays, objects, and events
* You may or may not know Vue already (we’ll briefly recap what you need)

If you have never seen Vue before, you can still follow along, but you might want to keep the Vue docs open for quick reference. Testing

## What you will learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Explain **what Nuxt is** and when to use it
* Create a new Nuxt project and run it locally with the **dev server**
* Understand the **file‑based routing** and default **project structure**
* Build reusable **components** and use **props** and **slots**
* Work with **Nuxt hooks** (lifecycle hooks, server and route hooks)
* Manage **state** with Nuxt’s built‑in tools and patterns
* Apply **best practices** for file structure, performance, and DX (developer experience)

## Course structure

This course is organized into modules and chapters, each building on the previous one.

### Module 1: Nuxt Basics (`01-nuxt-basics`)

You’ll learn the foundations of Nuxt:

* **Nuxt overview** – what Nuxt is solving and its core ideas
* **Tooling and dev server** – how to create and run a Nuxt app
* **Project structure** – understanding the `pages`, `components`, and other key directories

Later modules (not yet listed here) will cover:

* **Components in depth** – props, slots, layouts, and patterns
* **Hooks in Nuxt** – lifecycle hooks, route hooks, and server hooks
* **State management** – using composables, `useState`, and integrating external stores
* **Best practices** – performance, code style, folder structure, and deployment tips

## How to follow this course

To get the most out of this course:

1. **Code along** with each chapter. Don’t just read; type the code.
2. Use **version control** (like Git) so you can experiment safely.
3. Pause to read **Nuxt docs** when something is new or confusing.
4. Ask yourself: “How would I use this in a small app I care about?”

You’ll see code examples and short exercises throughout. Try to adapt them to your own idea (like a todo app, notes app, or simple blog).

## Prerequisites in detail

You should already be comfortable with:

* **HTML**: basic page structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`), common tags (`<div>`, `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`)
* **CSS**: using classes, basic layout (flexbox or simple grid), fonts, colors, spacing
* **JavaScript**: variables (`let`, `const`), functions, arrays, objects, DOM events, and basic ES6 syntax (arrow functions, template strings)

Some **Vue familiarity** helps, but is not a strict requirement. We will:

* Use the **Composition API** in most examples (`setup`, `ref`, `computed`)
* Briefly explain Vue single‑file components (`.vue` files)

If these sound intimidating, consider reviewing a short Vue introduction before continuing.

## Development setup

To follow along, you’ll need:

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended, e.g. 18+)
* A **package manager**: `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`
* A modern **code editor** (VS Code recommended)
* A modern **browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

We’ll use the command line to create and run projects, but only a few simple commands are needed.

## Learning goals for Module 1

In **Module 1: Nuxt Basics**, you will:

* Understand the **problem Nuxt solves** compared to plain Vue
* Learn how to **create** a new Nuxt app using the official CLI
* Run the **dev server**, inspect hot‑reloading, and read the console
* Explore the **default project structure**: `pages/`, `components/`, `app.vue`, `nuxt.config.ts`

This is the foundation for everything else in the course.
