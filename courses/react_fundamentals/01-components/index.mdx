New components
Test`} />

In this module, you’ll build reusable components, pass data with props, and render lists with confident, readable code.

## What You’ll Build

* A small UI composed of reusable parts (cards, buttons, list items)
* A list with empty and loading states
* Clean conditional rendering using common patterns

## Learning Outcomes

By the end, you can:

* Explain what a React component is and how it renders
* Write JSX and pass/receive props (including `children`)
* Render arrays with `map` and choose stable `key` values
* Implement conditional UI with `&&`, ternary, and early returns

## Chapters

* [What Is a Component](./01-what-is-a-component.mdx)
* [JSX and Props](./02-jsx-and-props.mdx)
* [Rendering Lists and Conditional UI](./03-rendering-lists-and-conditional.mdx)

## Before You Start

* Project created with Vite or your preferred setup
* You can run `npm run dev` and see the starter page
* Files: `main.jsx`, `App.jsx`, and a `src` folder

## Suggested Project Setup

Create a fresh Vite project if you don’t have one yet:

```bash
npm create vite@latest components-lab -- --template react
cd components-lab
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tips for Success

* Keep components small and focused
* Prefer composition over deep prop drilling
* Name components in PascalCase and files in a predictable structure

## Common Pitfalls

* Returning multiple elements without a wrapper (use a fragment `<>...</>`)
* Using `class` instead of `className` in JSX
* Forgetting to add a `key` when rendering lists

## What’s Next

When you finish, continue to Hooks to add interactivity with state and effects.
