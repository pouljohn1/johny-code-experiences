LOCAL CODE CHANGES

This course guides you from your first component to writing clean, maintainable React apps. You’ll learn by building small features step by step.

## Who This Course Is For
- Beginners to React
- Comfortable with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- New to modern SPA frameworks and component-based thinking

## Prerequisites
- HTML basics (elements, attributes)
- CSS basics (classes, layout)
- JavaScript fundamentals (variables, functions, arrays, objects, ES6 modules)

## What You’ll Learn
- Components: JSX, props, composition, lists, and conditional UI
- Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, derived state, custom hooks (Module 2)
- State Management: local vs lifted state, context, patterns (Module 3)
- Best Practices: folder structure, naming, performance tips, accessibility (Module 4)

## Course Structure
- Module 1: Components (start here) → [Open](./01-components/index.mdx)
- Module 2: Hooks (coming next)
- Module 3: State Management (coming next)
- Module 4: Best Practices (coming next)

Each module includes short lessons, examples, and exercises. Expect to write code in every chapter.

## Time and Tools
- Estimated time: 6–10 hours total (self-paced)
- You’ll need:
  - Node.js LTS and npm
  - A code editor (VS Code recommended)
  - A modern browser with React DevTools

## Getting Started
1) Create a new React app with Vite

```bash
npm create vite@latest react-fundamentals -- --template react
cd react-fundamentals
npm install
npm run dev
```

2) Open the project in your editor and your local dev server URL in the browser.

## How You’ll Learn
- Learn the concept → see a minimal example → build a small exercise
- Frequent knowledge checks to reinforce understanding
- Real-world tips and “gotchas” to avoid common mistakes

## Capstone Mini-Project
Across modules, you’ll assemble a simple “Contacts” or “Tasks” feature:
- Render a list with empty/loading states
- Add interactions using state and hooks
- Apply best practices for readability and reuse

## Next Steps
Jump to Module 1 and create your first React components:
- [Module 1: Components](./01-components/index.mdx)
