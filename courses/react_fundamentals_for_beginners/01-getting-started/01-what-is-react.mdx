React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It helps you build complex UIs from small, reusable pieces called **components**.

## Learning objectives

After this chapter, you should be able to:

- Explain what React is in one or two sentences
- Describe why React is useful compared to manual DOM manipulation
- Understand the ideas of **components**, **state**, and **props** at a high level

## The problem React solves

Before libraries like React, you often wrote code like this:

```javascript
// Imperative DOM manipulation example
const button = document.createElement("button");
button.textContent = "Click me";

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Clicked!");
});

document.body.appendChild(button);
```

As your app grows, you must manually:

- Create and insert elements
- Update text and classes when data changes
- Remove old elements
- Keep the UI in sync with your data

This quickly becomes hard to manage.

## What React does differently

React takes a **declarative** approach.

Instead of telling the browser *how* to update the UI step by step, you describe **what the UI should look like** for a given state.

You write something like:

```jsx
function Button() {
  return <button>Click me</button>;
}
```

React figures out how to update the real DOM when things change.

### Imperative vs declarative

- **Imperative**: "Do this, then this, then this…" (lots of DOM methods)
- **Declarative**: "Here is what the UI should look like given this data"

React is **declarative**. You describe the end result, and React handles the updates.

## Components: The building blocks

A **component** is a reusable piece of UI.

- It is usually a **JavaScript function**
- It returns **JSX** (HTML-like syntax) that describes what should appear on the screen
- It can accept **props** (inputs) and manage **state** (internal data)

Example:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}
```

Later, React can render `<Greeting />` on the page. You can also reuse this component in multiple places.

## A quick look at JSX

**JSX** is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

Under the hood, this is turned into regular JavaScript calls, but you mostly don’t need to worry about that at the beginning. Just remember:

- JSX must have **one parent element**
- You use `className` instead of `class`
- You embed JavaScript expressions with `{}`

You’ll practice JSX more in the next chapters.

## State and props (high-level view)

You’ll learn these in detail later, but for now:

- **State**: data that can change over time *inside* a component (like whether a modal is open)
- **Props**: data passed **into** a component from the outside (like a `title` for a card)

You can think of a component as a little machine:

- **Props**: inputs
- **State**: internal memory
- **JSX**: output (what the UI looks like)

React updates the UI automatically when props or state change.

## How React fits in your existing knowledge

You already know:

- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for logic

React helps you **combine** these skills into reusable components:

- HTML-like structure inside JSX
- CSS via classes or other patterns
- JavaScript for logic and data

You are not throwing away your previous knowledge; you are organizing it with React.

## Summary

- React is a **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces
- It uses a **declarative** approach rather than manual DOM updates
- **Components** are reusable pieces of UI
- **JSX** is an HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript
- **State** and **props** are key ideas for data in components

In the next chapter, you will set up your tools and create a project where you can try React code.
