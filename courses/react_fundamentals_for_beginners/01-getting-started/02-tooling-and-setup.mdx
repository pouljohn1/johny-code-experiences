In this chapter, you’ll set up the tools needed to run a modern React app on your computer.

## Learning objectives

After this chapter, you will be able to:

- Install or confirm **Node.js** and **npm** on your machine
- Create a new React project using **Vite** (a fast build tool)
- Run the development server and open the app in the browser
- Identify the key files in a new React project

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

React projects typically use **Node.js** and **npm** or **yarn**/**pnpm** to manage dependencies.

1. Go to the official Node.js website: `https://nodejs.org/`
2. Download the **LTS** version for your operating system
3. Run the installer and accept the defaults

After installation, open a terminal and check:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see version numbers for both commands. If not, restart your terminal or check the installation.

## Step 2: Choose a folder for your projects

Pick a folder where you want to keep your React projects, for example:

- `C:/code/react-projects` on Windows
- `~/code/react-projects` on macOS/Linux

In your terminal, navigate there. Example:

```bash
cd ~/code/react-projects
```

## Step 3: Create a new React project with Vite

We’ll use **Vite** because it’s fast and simple.

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-first-react-app -- --template react
```

Explanation:

- `npm create vite@latest` downloads the latest Vite starter
- `my-first-react-app` is the project folder name (you can change it)
- `--template react` tells Vite to set up a React project

You’ll see Vite ask a few simple questions. When it finishes, go into the new folder:

```bash
cd my-first-react-app
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This downloads React, ReactDOM, and other required packages.

## Step 4: Run the development server

Start the dev server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see output similar to:

```text
VITE vX.X.X  ready in X ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

Open the shown URL in your browser. You should see the default Vite + React starter page.

If nothing appears:

- Make sure the command is still running (do not close the terminal)
- Check for error messages in the terminal
- Try another browser

Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal to stop the dev server when you’re done.

## Step 5: Open the project in your editor

Open VS Code, then:

1. Click **File → Open Folder**
2. Select the `my-first-react-app` folder
3. Explore the files in the sidebar

You’ll see something like:

- `index.html`
- `src/main.jsx`
- `src/App.jsx`
- `package.json`

We care mostly about the `src` folder for now.

### Key files

- **`src/main.jsx`**
  - Entry point that tells React to render your app
- **`src/App.jsx`**
  - The main **App component** you will edit

Open `src/App.jsx` and you should see a component definition using JSX.

## Common setup issues

- **Command not found**: If `node` or `npm` is not recognized, Node.js might not be installed correctly or your terminal needs to be restarted
- **Port already in use**: Another app may be using the same port; Vite usually picks another port automatically, watch the terminal output
- **Blank page**: Check the browser console for errors (Right-click → Inspect → Console)

## Summary

You have now:

- Installed Node.js and npm
- Created a new Vite + React project
- Started the development server and opened the app in your browser
- Located the main React files (`main.jsx` and `App.jsx`)

In the next chapter, you will edit `App.jsx` and create your very first custom component.
