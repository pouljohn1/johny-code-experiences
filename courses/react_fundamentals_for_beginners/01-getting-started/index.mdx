This module gives you a gentle introduction to React. You will learn what problems it solves, set up your tools, and write your first real React component.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain in simple words what React is and why it is popular
- Describe how React fits into the browser and your existing HTML/CSS/JS knowledge
- Install the basic tooling to run a React app on your machine
- Create, render, and tweak a simple function component

## Chapters in this module

1. **What Is React?**
   - Why React was created
   - Declarative vs imperative UI
   - Components at a high level

2. **Tooling and Setup**
   - Node.js, npm, and project setup
   - Using a modern React starter (like Vite)
   - Running the dev server and exploring the project structure

3. **Your First Component**
   - Writing a function component
   - Using JSX
   - Rendering to the page and making small changes

## How this module fits into the course

Everything later in the course assumes that:

- You can open and run a React project on your computer
- You know where the **root component** lives
- You are comfortable editing JSX and seeing changes in the browser

If any of these still feel fuzzy after this module, revisit the chapters and repeat the steps.
