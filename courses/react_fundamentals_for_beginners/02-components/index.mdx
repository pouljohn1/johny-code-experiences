React apps are built from components. In this module, you will learn how to define components, reuse them, and make them talk to each other with props.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain what a React component is and why it is useful
- Create function components that return JSX
- Use props to pass data into components
- Compose components to build simple UIs
- Apply basic best practices for component naming and structure

## Who this module is for

This module is designed for beginners who:

- Know basic **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Have created at least one simple React app (for example, from the Getting Started module)
- Want to understand how components really work and how to structure them

If you have not yet created a React app, go through the `01-getting-started` module first.

## What you will learn in this module

We will progressively deepen your understanding of components:

1. **Component basics**
   - What makes a component a component
   - Function components and JSX
   - Props as inputs
   - Rendering multiple components

2. **(In later chapters) Component composition**
   - Nesting components
   - Breaking UIs into smaller pieces
   - Container vs presentational components (high level)

3. **(In later chapters) Props patterns and best practices**
   - Default props through destructuring
   - Passing children
   - Avoiding deeply nested props when possible

> For now, only the first chapter, **Component Basics**, is available. Future chapters will build on this foundation.

## How this module fits into the course

- In **Getting Started**, you saw React, JSX, and created a first component.
- In **this module**, you will:
  - Learn a more systematic way to write and use components
  - Practice splitting UIs into logical pieces
  - Prepare for **state and hooks**, which we cover in later modules.

## Recommended pace and practice

- Read the chapter slowly and **type the examples yourself**, do not just copy-paste.
- After each section, try to:
  - Change some text or styles
  - Add another component of your own
  - Pass different props and see what breaks (then fix it)

At the end of the module, you should feel comfortable creating new components whenever you need them.
