title: "State and Events in React"
description: "Learn how to add interactivity to React components with state and event handlers."
---

In this module, you will learn how React components remember information over time using **state**, and how to respond to user actions using **events**.

## What you'll learn

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain what **state** is and when to use it
- Use the `useState` hook to store and update data in a component
- Handle user actions with **event handlers** (like clicks and input changes)
- Connect state and events to build interactive UI

## Where this fits in the course

You have already learned what React is, how to set up your environment, and how to create basic components with props.

Now you will:

- Move from **static** components to **interactive** ones
- Learn the difference between **props** (data from outside) and **state** (data managed inside a component)
- See how user input and state changes cause React to update the UI automatically

## Chapters in this module

1. **State and Events Basics** (`01-state-and-events-basics.mdx`)
   - What state is and why it matters
   - Using the `useState` hook
   - Handling events like button clicks
   - Building your first interactive component

In future modules, we will build on this foundation to manage more complex state and data flows.
