  script={`Hi there! Welcome to React Fundamentals for Beginners.

We’ll start from what React is, then build components, manage state with hooks, and learn practical best practices.

Follow along step by step, try the exercises, and you’ll be able to build your own React interfaces.

Let’s dive in below!`} />

This course teaches you modern React from the ground up. You’ll start with the core ideas, then move on to components, hooks, state management, and practical patterns.

## Who this course is for

- You know **HTML**, **CSS**, and basic **JavaScript** (variables, functions, arrays, objects)
- You have never used React, or you tried it briefly and felt lost
- You want to build real, interactive interfaces in the browser

## What you will learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Explain what **React** is and when to use it
- Create and compose **function components**
- Use **JSX** to describe UI
- Manage **state** with `useState`
- React to changes with **props** and **events**
- Use core **hooks** like `useEffect` for side effects
- Organize code with **component structure** and **folder layout**
- Apply **best practices** for readability and maintenance

## Course structure

This course is organized into modules, each with short, focused chapters.

### Module 1: Getting Started

- What React is and why it exists
- Tooling and setup with modern build tools
- Your first React component, step by step

### Later modules (not yet shown here)

You can extend the course with modules such as:

- **Components in Depth**: props, children, lists, conditional rendering
- **State and Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect`, derived state
- **Application State Management**: lifting state up, context, simple global state patterns
- **Best Practices**: file structure, naming, reusability, performance basics

## How to follow this course

- **Read actively**: type the code instead of copying
- **Experiment**: change values, add new elements, break things on purpose
- **Ask questions**: use the Woz section at the end of each chapter to quiz yourself
- **Go slowly**: it is better to really understand one idea than skim ten

## Tools you will need

- A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
- A code editor (VS Code is recommended)
- Node.js and npm (we will walk through setup in the next module)

## Learning mindset

React has a learning curve because it introduces new ideas like **components**, **declarative UI**, and **hooks**. That’s normal.

You don’t need to memorize everything. Focus on:

- Understanding **why** React works the way it does
- Practicing small examples
- Repeating the key patterns: **component → props → state → UI**

At any point, you can revisit earlier chapters.
