  script={`Hey! Welcome to Convex Chef.

This is a tool that lets you build real web apps just by describing what you want in plain English.

No coding, no complicated setup—just tell Chef what you need, and it builds it for you.

Let's explore how it works!`} />

Convex Chef is a **vibecoding tool** that helps you build web applications without writing any code. Think of it as having a skilled developer who builds exactly what you describe.

## The Magic of Vibecoding

Vibecoding means building software by describing your ideas in natural language. Instead of learning programming languages, you simply tell Convex Chef what you want:

> "Create a todo list app where I can add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them."

That's it! Convex Chef understands your description and builds a working app for you.

Style: modern, cheerful, slightly playful, using warm colors. Wide landscape format.`} />

## What Makes Convex Chef Special?

### 🗣️ Plain English Instructions

You don't need to learn special commands or syntax. Just describe what you want in the same way you'd explain it to a friend:

- "I want a chat app for my team"
- "Create a recipe collection where I can save my favorite recipes"
- "Build a simple expense tracker"

### ⚡ Instant Results

Within seconds, Convex Chef generates a working app that you can see and use immediately. No waiting, no setup, no installation.

### 🔄 Easy to Change

Not quite right? No problem! Just tell Chef what you'd like to change:

- "Make the buttons bigger"
- "Add a search feature"
- "Change the color to blue"

### 🌐 Real, Working Apps

These aren't just demos or prototypes. Convex Chef builds real web apps that:

- Store data (your todos, recipes, messages, etc.)
- Work on any device (phone, tablet, computer)
- Can be shared with others
- Update in real-time when multiple people use them

## How Does It Work?

Convex Chef uses AI to understand your descriptions and automatically:

1. **Design the interface** - Creates buttons, forms, and layouts
2. **Build the backend** - Sets up data storage and logic
3. **Make it work** - Connects everything together

You focus on **what** you want. Chef handles **how** to build it.
