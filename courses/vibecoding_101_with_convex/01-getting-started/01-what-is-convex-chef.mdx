  script={`In this short chapter we’ll set the stage.

You’ll hear what vibecoding means, what Convex Chef is, and what Convex does in the background.

No need to remember every detail — just get a feel for the ideas, and we’ll use them in the next steps.`} />

This is a **very quick** overview of three ideas you’ll see in this course.

## Vibecoding

**Vibecoding** means building software by describing what you want in **plain language**, instead of writing code.

You focus on the *idea* and the *feel* of the app (the vibe), and the tools generate the actual application for you.

## Convex Chef

**Convex Chef** is a **vibecoding tool** for building apps.

You type what you want your app to do, and Chef creates it for you based on Convex. You don’t touch code – you just describe features and changes.

## Convex

**Convex** is the **backend platform** under the hood.

It stores your data and keeps everything in sync, so when something changes, your app updates automatically for everyone using it.
