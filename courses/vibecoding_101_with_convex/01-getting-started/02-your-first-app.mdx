<AiVideo id="your-first-app-intro" script={`Alright, time to build your first app!

We'll create a simple todo list together—you'll see how easy it is to go from idea to working app.

Just follow along step by step, and in a few minutes you'll have something real.

Let's do this!`} />

Let's build your first app! We'll create a simple **todo list** where you can add tasks, mark them as done, and remove them.

## Step 1: Open Convex Chef

Go to [chef.convex.dev](https://chef.convex.dev) in your web browser.

You should see a clean interface with a big text area where you can describe your app.

## Step 2: Describe Your App

In the big text box, type this description:

> Create a todo list app where I can add new tasks, mark tasks as complete with a checkbox, and delete tasks I don't need anymore.

That's all you need—just plain language.

## Step 3: Generate Your App

Click the **Generate** button (or press Enter).

Convex Chef will read what you wrote and build an app for you in a few seconds.

## Step 4: See Your App

When it's done, you'll see:

* A **chat area on the left** (where you can ask for changes later)
* A **project area on the right** with tabs like `Code`, `Preview`, and `Database`

Click the **`Preview`** tab to open your app. You should see something like this (of course AI could create something different).

## Step 5: Try It Out

In the preview, you can:

* **Add tasks** – type a task (like "Buy milk") and click the button
* **Mark tasks done** – click the checkbox next to a task
* **Remove tasks** – click the delete or trash button next to a task

Play with it a bit to see how it behaves.

## What You Just Did

In a few simple steps, you:

* Described an idea in your own words
* Generated a real, working app
* Used it right away in your browser

No coding, no setup—Convex Chef handled everything for you.

In the next chapter, we'll look around the interface so you understand what you're seeing and where to ask for changes.
