Now that you've built your first app, let's explore the Convex Chef interface. Understanding where everything is will help you build and customize apps more effectively.

## The Main Areas

Convex Chef's interface has several key areas. Let's look at each one:

  prompt={`A labeled diagram of the Convex Chef interface showing the main areas:
- Top: prompt input bar
- Left side: chat/conversation history
- Center: live app preview
- Right side: code/configuration panel

Use arrows and labels to clearly identify each section. Style: clean, educational diagram with soft colors. Wide landscape format.`} />

## 1. The Prompt Bar (Top)

This is where the magic happens! The prompt bar is where you describe your app or request changes.

**What you can do:**
- Describe a new app to build
- Request changes to your current app
- Ask questions about your app
- Add new features

**Tips:**
- Be specific about what you want
- Use natural language—just like talking to a person
- You can be as detailed or as simple as you like

**Example prompts:**
- "Add a due date field to each task"
- "Make the app look more colorful"
- "Add categories for organizing tasks"

## 2. The Preview (Center)

The center of the screen shows your live app. This is what your users will see and interact with.

**What you can do:**
- Test your app in real-time
- See changes immediately after requesting them
- Click and interact just like a normal website

**Try this:**
Click around your app! Add items, check boxes, delete things. Everything you do here is real—it's actually using your app.

## 3. The Chat History (Left)

On the left side, you'll see your conversation with Convex Chef. This shows all the prompts you've given and what Chef built in response.

**Why it's useful:**
- Review what you've asked for
- Go back to previous versions
- Understand how your app evolved
- Learn from what worked well

**Tip:** Think of this as your project history. You can scroll back to see every change you've made.

## 4. The Technical View (Right)

The right panel shows technical details about your app. Don't worry if this looks complicated—you don't need to understand it to use Convex Chef!

**What's shown:**
- The database structure (how your data is organized)
- The code that runs your app
- Configuration settings

**For now:** You can mostly ignore this panel. As you get more comfortable, you might want to peek at it to understand how your app works behind the scenes.

## Additional Interface Elements

### The Share Button

Look for a **Share** or **Link** button (usually in the top-right). This lets you:
- Copy the URL to your app
- Share it with others
- Access your app from different devices

### The Refresh Button

If something seems stuck, you can refresh the preview to reload your app.

### Settings/Menu

Some versions of Convex Chef have a menu (often three dots or lines) where you can:
- Start a new project
- Access saved apps
- Change settings

## Navigation Tips

**Tip 1: The prompt bar is your friend**  
Whenever you want to do something, just type it in the prompt bar. You don't need to click around or find special buttons.

**Tip 2: Watch the preview**  
After every change request, look at the center preview to see what happened. This helps you understand what Chef did.

**Tip 3: Keep your chat history**  
Don't clear your conversation history unless you're starting a completely new project. It's useful to see how you got where you are.

**Tip 4: Test often**  
After Chef makes a change, test your app in the preview. Click buttons, add data, make sure everything works as expected.

## What If Something Doesn't Look Right?

No problem! The interface is designed to be forgiving:

- **Can't find something?** Ask Chef in the prompt bar: "Where can I see my database?"
- **Confused by a panel?** You can usually minimize or hide panels you're not using
- **Want to undo?** Ask Chef to revert: "Go back to how it was before"

## Practice Exercise

Take 2 minutes to explore:

1. Look at your chat history—what prompts did you give?
2. Click around your app in the preview
3. Find the share button (you'll use this later!)
4. Peek at the technical panel (just to see what's there)

You don't need to understand everything yet. Just get familiar with where things are.

## You're Ready!

Now that you know your way around the interface, you're ready to start making changes to your app. That's what we'll cover in the next chapter!
