You've seen the interface in the video. Here's a very short recap of what you're looking at.

## Chat on the Left

On the **left side**, you see the **chat**.

* This is where you **type prompts** to change or add things to your app
* Just describe what you want in plain language

## App Area on the Right

On the **right side**, you see the **app section**.

It has three tabs:

* `Code`
* `Preview`
* `Database`

### Code

`Code` is where the **whole app code** lives.

* Contains the **HTML** (what you see on the page)
* Contains the **JavaScript** (how the page behaves)
* Contains the **server functions** (what runs on the backend)

You don’t need to edit this, but it’s there if you’re curious.

### Preview

`Preview` shows the **frontend app**.

* This is the version you can **click and play with**
* Add items, press buttons, try things out

### Database

`Database` shows the **Convex database and server functions**.

* You can see how your data is stored
* You can see the functions that work with that data

## Try It Yourself

Now, **play with it**:

* Send a prompt in the chat on the left
* Switch between `Code`, `Preview`, and `Database` on the right
* Use `Preview` to test how your app works

This will help you get a feel for how Convex Chef can be used.
