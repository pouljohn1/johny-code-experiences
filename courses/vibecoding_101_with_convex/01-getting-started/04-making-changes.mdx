  script={`Now it's time to refine your app.

Use the chat to ask for any changes you like, in your own words.

If you’re not sure where to start, try some of the example prompts below and see what happens.

Have fun experimenting and making the app truly yours!`} />

Now that your app is running, this chapter is all about **playing with it** and **changing it**.

You can ask Convex Chef to update your app just by typing what you want in the **chat on the left**.

Below are some ready‑to‑use prompts you can copy, paste, and try.

## Try Simple Style Changes

Copy one of these into the chat on the left and send it:

```
Change the app to use a light blue background and slightly bigger text.
```

```
Make the buttons larger and more colorful so they are easier to click.
```

```
Add more space between each todo item so the list feels less crowded.
```

After you send a prompt, look at the **Preview** on the right and click around your app to see what changed.

## Try New Features

Here are some ideas for small new features. Pick one and try it:

```
Add a button that removes all completed tasks at once.
```

```
Show a small counter at the top that tells me how many tasks I still need to do.
```

```
Allow me to edit a task after I created it, for example to fix a typo.
```

```
Move completed tasks to a separate section at the bottom of the list.
```

Again, after each prompt, check the **Preview** and test the new feature.

## Try Changing the Layout

You can also change how things are arranged on the page:

```
Put the input box and the Add button in a single row, next to each other.
```

```
Make the list of tasks narrower and centered in the middle of the screen.
```

```
Add a small title at the top that says "My Tasks" in a nice, bold style.
```

## Bonus Task: Add Categories with Badges

For an extra challenge, try adding **categories** to each todo item.

Your goal:

- Each task should have a category (for example: Work, Home, Shopping)
- The category should be shown as a **small badge** next to the task text

You can start with a prompt like this:

```
Add a category field to each todo item, for example Work, Home, or Shopping, and show the category as a small colored badge next to the task text.
```

## What's Next

In the **next chapter**, you’ll learn how to **ship and publish** your app so other people can use it too.

For now, feel free to keep experimenting with prompts and refining your app.
