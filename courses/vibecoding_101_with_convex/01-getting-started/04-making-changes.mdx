In this chapter, you'll learn how to request changes, add features, and customize your app to work exactly how you want.

The best part? It's as easy as asking for what you want.

Let's start making changes!`} />

Your todo list is working, but let's make it better! In this chapter, you'll learn how to customize and improve your app by making change requests to Convex Chef.

## The Power of Iteration

**Iteration** means making small improvements over time. You don't need to get everything perfect on the first try. Instead:

1. Build something basic
2. Try it out
3. See what could be better
4. Request improvements
5. Repeat!

This is how professional developers work, and it's how you'll work with Convex Chef.

## Making Your First Change

Let's make your todo list more useful. We'll add a feature to see when tasks were created.

### Step 1: Decide What You Want

Think about what would make your app better. For example:
- "Show when each task was added"
- "Add a button to clear all completed tasks"
- "Make urgent tasks show in red"

Let's start with the first one.

### Step 2: Ask for the Change

In the prompt bar, type:

> Add a timestamp to each task showing when it was created

Then press Enter or click Generate.

### Step 3: Wait for Chef

Convex Chef will update your app. This usually takes just a few seconds.

### Step 4: Check the Results

Look at your app preview. You should now see timestamps (like "Added 2 minutes ago") next to each task!

Try adding a new task. See the timestamp appear? That's iteration in action! 🎉

## More Changes to Try

Let's make a few more improvements to get comfortable with the process.

### Change 2: Better Visual Design

Try this prompt:

> Make the app look more modern with better colors and larger, more readable text

Chef will update the styling. Your app should look more polished!

### Change 3: Add a Feature

Request a new feature:

> Add a button that clears all completed tasks at once

Now you have a "Clear Completed" button. Test it by:
1. Marking a few tasks as complete
2. Clicking the new button
3. Watching them disappear!

### Change 4: Improve Organization

Make your app more organized:

> Show completed tasks separately at the bottom with a lighter color

Your tasks are now grouped—active ones on top, completed ones below.

## Tips for Making Good Changes

### Be Specific

❌ Vague: "Make it better"  
✅ Specific: "Add a search box to filter tasks by keyword"

❌ Vague: "Change the colors"  
✅ Specific: "Use a blue theme with white text on buttons"

### One Change at a Time

Instead of:
> "Add categories, due dates, priorities, tags, and a calendar view"

Try:
> "Add categories so I can group tasks by project"

Then, after that works:
> "Add due dates to each task"

Smaller changes are easier for Chef to implement correctly.

### Test After Each Change

After Chef makes a change:
1. Look at the preview
2. Click around and test it
3. Make sure it works as expected

If something isn't quite right, just ask for another adjustment!

### Use Examples

If you have a specific vision, describe it:

> "Add a priority field with three options: Low, Medium, High. High priority tasks should have a red border."

The more detail you provide, the closer Chef gets to your vision.

## When Things Don't Work Perfectly

Sometimes Chef might not understand exactly what you want. That's okay! Here's what to do:

### Strategy 1: Clarify Your Request

If the change isn't quite right, explain what's wrong:

> "The timestamps are too small. Make them bigger and easier to read."

### Strategy 2: Try Different Words

If Chef seems confused, rephrase your request:

Instead of: "Make the UI pop"  
Try: "Add colorful buttons and increase the spacing between elements"

### Strategy 3: Break It Down

If a complex change doesn't work, split it into smaller pieces:

Instead of: "Reorganize everything to be more user-friendly"  
Try:
1. "Group related buttons together"
2. "Add clear labels to each section"
3. "Increase the font size for better readability"

### Strategy 4: Ask to Revert

If a change made things worse:

> "Undo the last change and go back to how it was before"

## Practice Exercise

Time to make your todo list your own! Try making at least 3 of these changes:

1. Add a due date to each task
2. Change the color scheme to your favorite colors
3. Add categories (like "Work", "Personal", "Shopping")
4. Show a count of how many tasks you have
5. Add the ability to edit existing tasks
6. Make it mobile-friendly with larger touch targets

Remember: one change at a time, and test after each one!

## You're Becoming a Vibecoder!

Congratulations! You now know how to:

✅ Build an app from scratch
✅ Navigate the Convex Chef interface
✅ Request changes and improvements
✅ Iterate on your ideas

These are the core skills of vibecoding. You're not writing code, but you're definitely building software!

## What's Next?

In the next module, we'll explore different types of apps you can build and learn techniques for describing more complex features.

Keep experimenting with your todo list. The more you practice requesting changes, the better you'll get at communicating your ideas to Convex Chef!
