<AiVideo id="shipping-and-sharing-intro" script={`Now it’s time to ship what you built.

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to deploy your app with Convex Chef and then share it using Hacklab projects.

We’ll keep it simple: first click Deploy, then add your project so others can see what you made.

Let’s get your app out into the world!`} />

You’ve built and refined your app. Now let’s **put it online** and **share it** with others.

We’ll do this in two steps:

1. **Deploy with Chef** – put your app on a public web address
2. **Add your project in Hacklab** – share what you built with the community

## Deploy with Chef

At the top‑right corner of Convex Chef, you’ll see a **Deploy** button.

### 1. Click "Deploy"

* Make sure your app is open in Convex Chef
* In the **top‑right corner**, click the **Deploy** button

* Chef will start deploying your app (this can take a short moment)

> When deployment is done, the **Deploy** button will change into **View site**.

You can then click **View site** to open your live app in a new tab.

> My app can be seen at [https://famous-mosquito-884.convex.app/](https://famous-mosquito-884.convex.app/)

Your app will get its **own link** (URL) that you can:

* Open on your phone or another computer
* Send to friends, coworkers, or community members

## Add Project in Hacklab

Now that your app is live, you can **share it as a project**.

We’ll use **Hacklab Projects** for that.

1. Open this page in your browser:
   * [https://hacklab.so/projects/submit](https://hacklab.so/projects/submit)
2. Fill in the form:
   * Give your project a **name**
   * Add a short **description** of what it does
   * Paste the **URL of your deployed app** (from the "View site" link)
3. Submit the project

That’s it! You’ve:

* Built an app with Convex Chef
* Deployed it with a single button
* Shared it with others through Hacklab
