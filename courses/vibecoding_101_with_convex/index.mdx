Welcome to **VibeCoding 101**! You're about to discover how to build real web applications without any coding experience.

## What is VibeCoding?

**VibeCoding** is building apps by describing what you want in plain English. Instead of learning programming languages, you simply tell an AI assistant what your app should do, and it creates it for you.

Think of it like ordering at a restaurant—you describe what you want, and the chef makes it happen. That's exactly how **Convex Chef** works! 👨‍🍳

## What is Convex Chef?

[Convex Chef](https://chef.convex.dev/) is a free tool that turns your ideas into working web apps. You type what you want (like "a todo list app" or "a chat room"), and Chef builds it for you in seconds.

**No coding required.** Just describe your vision, and Chef handles the technical stuff.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

✅ Turn your ideas into working web apps  
✅ Chat with Convex Chef to build features  
✅ Customize and improve your apps  
✅ Share your creations with others

## What You Need

All you need is:

- **A web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- **An internet connection**
- **Your creativity and curiosity!** 🚀

**No programming knowledge needed.** If you've never written code before, that's perfectly fine—this course is designed for you!

## How This Course Works

Each chapter teaches you something new through:

- **Simple explanations** in everyday language
