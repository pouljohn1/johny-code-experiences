## Step-by-Step Guide

In this chapter, you'll learn how to use v0—an AI-powered web code editor designed for vibe coding. Follow along with the video using these steps.

### Step 1: Getting Started with v0

1. Open [v0.app](https://v0.app) in your browser
2. If you don't have an account, click the **Sign Up** button to register
3. Complete the registration process

### Step 2: Creating Your First Web App

Once you're signed in, you'll see the v0 main page with an input field in the center. This is where you'll write prompts to create your web app.

**Example prompt to try:**
```
Build me a landing page for my startup. My startup uses AI to help people learn new things. The design needs to be sleek with lots of modern effects.
```

After sending your prompt:
- The AI will begin writing code in real time
- Within moments, you'll see your first AI-generated landing page
- The page is fully functional and ready to customize

### Step 3: Understanding the v0 Interface

**Left Sidebar Tabs:**
- **Chat** - Interact with the AI to make changes and improvements
- **Design** - Customize fonts, colors, and visual elements
- **Connect** - Hook up external data sources (covered in later modules)
- **Vars** - Set custom variables for data sources (covered in later modules)
- **Rules** - Write custom instructions for the AI agent
- **Settings** - General configuration options

**Center Panel:**
- **Preview Mode** - See your website as users will see it
- **Code Mode** - View the complete source code (toggle using the toolbar icons)
- The preview is fully interactive—try clicking navigation links to see it behave like a real website

### Step 4: Publishing Your Web App

1. Click the **Publish** button at the top of the screen
2. In the **Customize Domain** field, enter your preferred subdomain name (e.g., `learn-ai-with-experts`)
3. Leave other options at their default settings for now
4. Click **Publish to Production**
5. Your website is now live on the internet!

### What You've Accomplished

You've successfully created and published your first vibe-coded web page using AI. The entire process—from concept to live website—took just a few minutes.

Now that you've watched the video, it's time to reinforce your learning! Complete the extra tasks below and test your knowledge with Woz.

## Extra Vocabulary

> **📍 Domain**
>
> A unique web address that identifies a website on the internet (e.g., `google.com`, `v0.dev`). Think of it as your website's home address.

> **🏢 Subdomain**
>
> A subdivision of a domain that appears before the main domain name (e.g., `learn-ai-with-experts.v0.app`). It's like an apartment number within a building's address.

> **💻 Source Code**
>
> The human-readable instructions and text that make up a web application. It's what developers write and what browsers read to display your website.

> **🤖 AI Agent**
>
> An artificial intelligence system that can understand your instructions in natural language and automatically generate code, designs, and complete websites based on your prompts.

## Extra Tasks

### Task 1: Customize Your Design
- Change the font and theme colors in your web app

> **Having problems?**
>
> Go to the `Design` menu on the left sidebar and there you'll find options to change `Fonts` and `Colors`. Play around with different combinations and see how they transform your site!

### Task 2: Iterate with the Chat
- Use the Chat tab to ask v0 to add a new section to your landing page (e.g., "Add a pricing section with three tiers")
- Make at least one more change based on the AI's response

> **Having problems?**
>
> Click on the `Chat` tab in the left sidebar, type your request in natural language, and press Enter. The AI will modify your existing page based on your instructions!

### Task 3: Explore the Source Code
- Switch to Code view and identify where your website's heading text is located
- Try to spot the difference between the code for different sections of your page

> **Having problems?**
>
> Click the Code icon in the toolbar at the top of the center panel. Look for text that matches what you see in the preview—that's where the content is defined!

### Task 4: Create a Different Type of Web App
- Start a new v0 project and create something completely different (e.g., a personal portfolio, a restaurant menu, or a product showcase)
- Experiment with different prompt styles to see how they affect the output

> **Having problems?**
>
> Click the v0 logo or "New" button to start fresh. Be specific in your prompt about what you want—mention the purpose, style, and any specific features you'd like to include!

### Challenge Task 🌟
- Create a landing page for an imaginary product or service, then iterate on it at least 3 times using the Chat to refine different aspects (design, content, layout)
- Publish it with a custom subdomain that reflects your imaginary business

> **Having problems?**
>
> Start with a clear initial prompt, then use follow-up messages like "Make the hero section more eye-catching," "Add customer testimonials," or "Make the call-to-action button more prominent." Each iteration helps you learn how to communicate better with AI!

context={`Ask user the following questions, one by one. Don't ask any other questions.
1. What is v0 and what is it used for?
2. What is a subdomain?
3. How do you communicate with the AI agent in v0?

<agent-context>v0 is a web-based AI tool available at v0.app. It allows users to create web applications by writing prompts in natural language. The AI agent interprets these prompts and generates complete source code, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can then customize the design, add functionality, and publish their sites directly from the platform.</agent-context>
