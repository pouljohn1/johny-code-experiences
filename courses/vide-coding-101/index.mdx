script="Hey there! I'm Mia, and welcome to Vibe Coding 1-on-1. This course is all about turning your ideas into real, working apps—no coding experience required. We'll use modern AI tools to build fast, ship faster, and learn by doing. Throughout this course, you'll see me in some videos explaining concepts and guiding you through the process, but you'll also learn from experienced programmers who will show you exactly how to write and refine code on screen. Think of this as your personal mentoring session where you get the best of both worlds: clear explanations from me and hands-on demonstrations from developers who do this every day. Whether you're a founder with a vision, a designer wanting to bring your concepts to life, or simply someone curious about building for the web, this course will help you ship real projects. Let's start with Module 1, where we'll create and deploy your first landing page using v0 and Vercel. Ready? Let's dive in!"

Build faster by thinking in vibes, not wireframes. In this 1‑on‑1 course, we use a collection of modern no/low‑code and AI tooling to translate intent into UI, iterate rapidly with structured prompts, and ship production‑ready apps. Module 1 starts with v0 and Vercel; later modules introduce additional tools and workflows. Each session is practical, collaborative, and focused on outcomes—together we design, generate, edit, and deploy.


## Who This Is For

- Non‑programmers who want to turn ideas into real web pages and apps
- Creators, founders, and product folks who want to ship without learning to code
- Designers who want to transform concepts into functional UIs—no coding required

## Prerequisites

- None. You only need a computer and access to the internet.

## What You’ll Learn

- Turning product intent into clear, effective prompts
- Iterating on UI (style, structure, components) through prompt refinement
- Light, optional edits to generated code when helpful
- Connecting basic content and simple actions
- Publishing apps to the web with confidence

## Course Format

- Live 1‑on‑1 sessions focused on building
- Short exercises between sessions to cement skills
- Real projects you can keep, extend, and deploy

## Module 1 — Introduction to Vibe Coding with v0

Kickstart your flow with v0 and ship your first app in under an hour. We’ll set up accounts, generate a simple landing page from a prompt, iterate on style and structure, and push live to Vercel.

### Topics

- Registering on v0
- Using your first prompt to build a simple landing page
- Improving the landing page (copy, layout, components, brand vibe)
- Extra exercises
- Publishing your application on Vercel

### Outcomes

By the end of Module 1, you will have:

- A live landing page deployed on Vercel
- A reusable prompt strategy for generating and refining UIs
- Comfort editing and re‑prompting to achieve consistent visual direction

### Deliverables

- v0 project link
- Public Vercel deployment URL
- Saved prompt iterations you can reuse in future modules

We’ll expand with more modules covering additional tools beyond v0/Vercel—think content, data, auth, actions, and polish. For now, let’s get your first app live.
