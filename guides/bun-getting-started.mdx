Bun is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime that aims to replace Node.js + npm + tools like Jest and Webpack with a single, batteries-included tool.

## What is Bun?

**Bun** is a JavaScript runtime like **Node.js** or **Deno**, built on top of **JavaScriptCore** (the engine powering Safari), written in **Zig**.

It focuses on:

- **Speed**: very fast startup and execution
- **Batteries included**: bundler, test runner, package manager, and more
- **Node.js compatibility**: supports many Node.js APIs, `node_modules`, and `require`

You can use Bun to:

- Run JavaScript/TypeScript apps
- Manage packages (instead of npm, pnpm, or yarn)
- Bundle and transpile code
- Run tests

If you already know Node.js, Bun will feel familiar but faster and more integrated.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Bun, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of **JavaScript** (variables, functions, modules)
- A **terminal** (macOS/Linux shell or Windows PowerShell/WSL)
- A **code editor** (VS Code, WebStorm, etc.)

You *do not* need to know Node.js deeply, but knowing what `npm` and `node` are will help.

## Installing Bun

### Supported platforms

Bun officially supports:

- macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel)
- Linux (various distributions)
- Windows (via WSL2; native support is improving, but WSL is most stable)

### Install on macOS or Linux

The recommended way is via the official install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

After installation, restart your terminal or run the shell setup it prints.

Verify the installation:

```bash
bun --version
```

You should see a version string like `1.x.x`.

### Install on Windows

The most reliable setup today is using **WSL2**:

1. Install **WSL2** and a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) from the Microsoft Store.
2. Open your WSL terminal.
3. Run the same install command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Then verify:

```bash
bun --version
```

> If you want native Windows support, check the latest Bun docs. Command-line behavior may change as Windows support matures.

## Your First Bun Script

Let’s run a simple "Hello, Bun" script.

1. Create a new folder and open it in your editor:

```bash
mkdir bun-hello
cd bun-hello
```

2. Create `index.ts` (Bun runs TS out of the box):

```ts
// index.ts

console.log("Hello from Bun!");
```

3. Run it with Bun:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

You should see:

```text
Hello from Bun!
```

You just ran TypeScript directly, no build step required.

## Using Bun as a Package Manager

Bun includes a fast package manager, compatible with the `package.json` ecosystem.

### Initialize a project

From your project folder:

```bash
bun init
```

Bun will ask a few questions and create a `package.json` for you.

Example `package.json` (simplified):

```json
{
  "name": "bun-hello",
  "module": "index.ts",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "bun run index.ts"
  }
}
```

### Installing dependencies

Install a package, e.g. `chalk` for colored terminal output:

```bash
bun add chalk
```

Bun will:

- Update `package.json`
- Create or update `bun.lockb`
- Install to `node_modules`

Use the package in `index.ts`:

```ts
// index.ts
import chalk from "chalk";

console.log(chalk.green("Hello from Bun with colors!"));
```

Run via script:

```bash
bun run start
```

> `bun add` is analogous to `npm install` or `pnpm add`, but is usually much faster.

## Running Scripts with Bun

Bun understands the `scripts` field in `package.json`.

Example `package.json` scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "bun run index.ts",
    "dev": "bun run --watch index.ts"
  }
}
```

Run a script:

```bash
bun run start
```

Run with file watching (auto-restart on changes):

```bash
bun run dev
```

> `bun run` can run both files (`bun run index.ts`) and `package.json` scripts (`bun run start`).

## Bun and TypeScript

One of Bun’s nicest features is **first-class TypeScript support**.

- No separate `ts-node` or `tsc` step required
- Just run `.ts` or `.tsx` files directly with `bun run`

Example with a simple function:

```ts
// greet.ts

function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Bun"));
```

Run it:

```bash
bun run greet.ts
```

Bun will transpile and execute it on the fly.

> You can still use a `tsconfig.json` for editor tooling and type checking with `tsc`, but Bun does not require it to run `.ts` files.

## Creating a Simple HTTP Server

Bun provides a lightweight HTTP server API that feels similar to `fetch`.

Create `server.ts`:

```ts
// server.ts

const server = Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(request) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);

    if (url.pathname === "/") {
      return new Response("Hello from Bun server!", {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" }
      });
    }

    return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
  },
});

console.log(`Server listening on http://localhost:${server.port}`);
```

Run it:

```bash
bun run server.ts
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

You’ll see:

```text
Hello from Bun server!
```

> This built-in server is great for APIs, microservices, or simple web backends without extra frameworks.

## Bun as a Test Runner

Bun ships with a Jest-style test runner called **`bun test`**.

Install `bun-types` for better TypeScript support (optional but helpful):

```bash
bun add -d bun-types
```

Create `sum.ts`:

```ts
// sum.ts
export function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

Create `sum.test.ts`:

```ts
// sum.test.ts
import { expect, test } from "bun:test";
import { sum } from "./sum";

test("adds two numbers", () => {
  expect(sum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});
```

Run tests:

```bash
bun test
```

You’ll see test results printed in the terminal.

## Using Bun as a Bundler

Bun can bundle JavaScript/TypeScript for production.

Example: bundle a TypeScript entry file for the browser:

```bash
bun build src/main.ts --outdir dist --target browser
```

Common options:

- `--outdir dist` – where to place bundled files
- `--target browser` / `--target bun` / `--target node` – output environment
- `--minify` – minify the bundle

Simple example:

```bash
bun build index.ts --outdir build --target bun --minify
```

This produces optimized output in `build/`.

## Common Bun CLI Commands

Here’s a quick reference for everyday Bun commands:

```bash
# Show version
bun --version

# Initialize a new project
bun init

# Run a file (JS/TS/TSX)
bun run file.ts

# Run a package.json script
bun run <script-name>

# Add dependencies
bun add <package>

# Add devDependencies
bun add -d <package>

# Remove a dependency
bun remove <package>

# Run tests
bun test

# Bundle code
bun build <entry> --outdir <dir>
```

## When to Use Bun

Bun is a strong choice when you want:

- Very fast **local development**
- An all-in-one tool: runtime, package manager, test runner, and bundler
- **TypeScript-first** development without extra setup
- Good Node.js compatibility but with better performance

You might stick with Node.js if:

- You rely on Node APIs or native modules that are not yet fully supported in Bun
- Your production environment is locked to Node.js and you can’t change it

In many greenfield projects, Bun is an excellent default.

## Next Steps

From here, you can:

- Build a small REST API with `Bun.serve`
- Create a CLI tool using Bun + TypeScript
- Explore frameworks that support Bun as a runtime
- Read the official Bun docs for deeper features (FFI, SQLite, more bundling options)
