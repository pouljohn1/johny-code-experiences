# My technology stack

NEW VERSION!

## Introduction

Technology stack is one of most important aspects of software development. It defines the tools, frameworks, and languages used to build applications. In this guide, I will show brief introduction to technology stack that I am currently using in my own app domalert.pl.

## Components

First to familiarize with whole concept I need to tell of which parts my stack consists:

- **Web** - a web user facing interface
- **Mobile** - a mobile application for iOS and Android
- **Backend** - a server-side application that handles business logic and data processing
- **Workers** - background processes that perform tasks asynchronously
- **Database** - a system for storing and managing data
- **DevOps** - tools and practices for deploying and maintaining applications

## Monorepo

All of the code for my stack is stored in a single repository, known as a monorepo. This allows for easier management of dependencies, shared code, and consistent development practices across all components. 

There are lot of monorepo tools available, but I am using [bun.js](https://bun.com/) workspaces. Bun.js is a modern and fast JavaScript toolkit which is replacement for Node.js and npm.

Folder sctructure looks as follows;

```
packages/
├── common/          # Common code shared across all packages
├── common-frontend/ # Common frontend related code
├── db-schema/       # Database schema and models
├── backend/         # Backend application
├── jobs/            # Utility jobs that can use multiple packages
├── mobile/          # Mobile application code
├── web/             # Web application code
└── worker/          # Workers that are used for scrapping
```

### Devops Stack

#### Backend and Database

Let's start from devops side. As of now I am using Hetzner Cloud for hosting my applications. It is a reliable and cost-effective cloud provider where prices starts from $10. It is great for small to medium-sized applications.

As of now I am using it only for hosting my backend and database. For that I have used [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) to manage my applications. Coolify is an open-source alternative to Heroku that allows you to deploy and manage applications easily. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing your applications, databases, and other resources.

#### Web

For the web application, I am using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as a hosting provider. Vercel is a platform for frontend frameworks and static sites, built to integrate with headless content management systems (CMS) and APIs. It provides a seamless deployment experience and is optimized for performance.

#### Mobile

For the mobile application, I am using [Expo](https://expo.dev/) as a framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React. It provides a set of tools and services that simplify the development process.

### Backend Stack

For the backend, I am using the following technologies:
- **bun.js** - a JavaScript runtime that is really fast and almost 100% Node.js compatible
- **Express.js** - a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications
- **Prisma** - an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database interactions and provides a type-safe API for working with databases
- **PostgreSQL** - a powerful, open-source relational database system that is used for storing and managing data
- **Redis** - an in-memory data structure store that is used for caching and real-time data processing
- **Stripe** - a payment processing platform that is used for in app purchases and subscriptions
- **AWS** - Amazon Web Services is used for file storage, specifically for storing images and other media files
- **OpenAi** - OpenAI's API is used for comparing simillar estates and finding best deals on the market

### Frontend Stack

For the frontend, I am using the following technologies:
- **Vite.js** - a fast and modern build tool that is used for building web applications
- **TypeScript** - a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language, making it easier to write and maintain large codebases
- **React** - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook
- **Mui** - a popular React UI framework that provides a set of components and styles for building responsive and accessible user interfaces
- **react-map-gl** - a React wrapper for Mapbox GL JS, which is used for rendering maps with estates

### Mobile Stack

For the mobile application, I am using the following technologies:
- **Expo** - a framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using React Native
- **TypeScript** - a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language, making it easier to write and maintain large codebases
- **React Native** - a framework for building native mobile applications using React
-- **react-native-maps** - a React Native library for rendering maps, which is used for displaying estates on the map

### Workers Stack

Workers are used for scrapping data from external sources and performing background tasks. For workers, I am using the following technologies:
- **bun.js**
- **Puppeteer** - a Node.js library that provides a high-level

## Final Notes

That's all for now. This is a brief overview of my technology stack that I am using for my own app domalert.pl. It is a modern and efficient stack that allows me to build and maintain my applications easily. 

In next guides I will go deeper into each component of the stack, explaining how they work together and how to set them up.
