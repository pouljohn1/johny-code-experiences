Nuxt.js is a framework on top of Vue that makes building modern web apps easier, especially for SSR, routing, and DX.

## What you will learn

- How to create a new Nuxt app
- Basic project structure
- How to run it in development and build for production

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Basic familiarity with JavaScript and Vue (helpful but not mandatory)

## 1. Create a new Nuxt project

From a terminal, run:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init my-nuxt-app
cd my-nuxt-app
npm install   # or pnpm install / yarn
```

This scaffolds a minimal Nuxt project in `my-nuxt-app`.

## 2. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed URL, usually:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the default Nuxt welcome page.

## 3. Basic project structure

Some key folders/files:

- `app.vue` – root component of your app
- `pages/` – every `.vue` file here becomes a route
- `nuxt.config.ts` – main config (modules, runtime options, etc.)
- `components/` – reusable Vue components

If `pages/` doesn’t exist, create it:

```bash
mkdir pages
```

Then add your first page:

```vue
<!-- pages/index.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello Nuxt</h1>
    <p>This is my first Nuxt page.</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

Visit `/` again and you should see this content.

## 4. Add another page (routing)

Create `pages/about.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Nuxt creates this route automatically at /about.</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

Nuxt’s **file-based routing** means `/pages/about.vue` is served at `/about` with no extra config.

## 5. Build for production

When you’re ready to build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview   # preview the production build
```

This compiles and optimizes your app. For deployment, follow Nuxt docs for your hosting platform (e.g., Node server, Static hosting with `npm run generate`, etc.).

## Next steps

- Explore the official docs: https://nuxt.com/docs
- Learn about **layouts**, **server routes**, and **data fetching** (e.g. `useAsyncData`)
- Add modules like `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` for styling or `@pinia/nuxt` for state
