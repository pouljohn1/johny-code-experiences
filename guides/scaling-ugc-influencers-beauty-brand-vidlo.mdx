You'll learn the challenges they faced, the solution they implemented, and the impressive results they achieved. This approach is perfect for brands looking to generate authentic user-generated content (UGC) at scale.

## The Challenge

The beauty brand needed to collect authentic, high-quality video content from a large number of influencers to fuel its TikTok strategy and drive awareness for a new product launch. They wanted a seamless solution that made it easy to scale—and ensured every video aligned with their polished brand aesthetic.

## 💡 The Vidlo Solution

Vidlo provided a streamlined approach that simplified every step of the campaign. Here's how it worked:

### 1. Seamless Link-Based Campaign Setup

The brand created a custom Vidlo campaign and sent a branded link to influencers. No apps to download, no logins required—just a simple tap to get started. This removed all technical barriers to participation.

### 2. Creators Record on Their Own Devices

Influencers recorded their UGC directly on their phones—reactions, tutorials, and unboxings—all guided by the brand's video prompt. This kept the process simple and familiar for creators while ensuring they captured the right content.

### 3. On-Brand Video Customization at Scale

Each submitted video was automatically customized with branded overlays, filters, and effects—matching the campaign's look and feel. This meant the final videos were not only authentic but also polished and ready to post, eliminating hours of manual editing work.

### 4. Centralized Dashboard for Instant Access

All content was collected and stored in the brand's Vidlo dashboard, giving their team instant access to download and repurpose content for paid ads, organic social, and influencer compilations. No more chasing down files or dealing with inconsistent formats.

### 5. Direct Sharing to TikTok

Influencers could share their edited, branded videos directly to TikTok. This ensured consistency across every creator's post—while also providing the brand with real-time insights into reach, engagement, and performance.
