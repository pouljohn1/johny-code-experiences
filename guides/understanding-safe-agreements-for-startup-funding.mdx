<AiVideo script="Hi there! Today we're diving into one of the most important innovations in startup funding: the SAFE agreement, or Simple Agreement for Future Equity. If you're a founder raising your first round of capital, or an early investor looking to understand modern investment instruments, this guide is for you. We'll start by explaining what a SAFE actually is and why Y Combinator created it back in 2013. Then we'll break down the key terms you need to know, like post-money SAFE, valuation caps, and the MFN provision. We'll also compare SAFEs to traditional convertible notes and equity rounds so you understand the tradeoffs. By the end, you'll know exactly when a SAFE makes sense for your fundraising strategy and when you might want to consider alternatives. This knowledge is critical whether you're on the founder side of the table or the investor side. The SAFE has become the industry standard for early-stage funding, so understanding it deeply will help you navigate your fundraising journey with confidence. Let's get started, and make sure to read through the detailed sections below to master this essential fundraising tool!" />

A **SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)** is a financial instrument that allows investors to provide capital to startups in exchange for the right to receive equity in the future, typically during a priced equity round.

Y Combinator pioneered the SAFE in 2013 to simplify early-stage fundraising and reduce the legal complexity and costs associated with traditional investment methods. Today, it has become the standard instrument for seed-stage investments, used by thousands of startups worldwide. 🚀

## What Is a SAFE Agreement?

A SAFE is **not a loan** and **not equity**—it's a unique hybrid instrument. When an investor gives you money via a SAFE, they don't immediately receive shares in your company. Instead, they receive the contractual right to obtain equity later, usually when a qualifying event occurs.

### Key Characteristics

- **No interest rate**: Unlike convertible notes, SAFEs don't accrue interest
- **No maturity date**: There's no deadline for repayment or conversion
- **Conversion trigger**: SAFEs typically convert during a priced equity financing round
- **Valuation deferral**: You don't need to set a company valuation at the time of investment

The genius of the SAFE is its simplicity. It's usually just a 5-page document compared to the 30+ pages of traditional investment agreements.

## Post-Money SAFE vs Pre-Money SAFE

Y Combinator updated the SAFE in 2018 to introduce the **post-money SAFE**, which has become the standard. Understanding this distinction is crucial for both founders and investors.

### Post-Money SAFE

A post-money SAFE calculates the investor's ownership percentage based on the company's valuation **after** the SAFE investment is included.

**Example**: If you raise $500,000 on a post-money SAFE with a $10 million valuation cap:
- The investor receives **5%** of the company ($500,000 / $10,000,000)
- This percentage is known at the time of investment
- Founder dilution is predictable

```python
# Post-money SAFE calculation
investment_amount = 500_000
valuation_cap = 10_000_000

investor_ownership = investment_amount / valuation_cap
print(f"Investor ownership: {investor_ownership * 100}%")
# Output: Investor ownership: 5.0%
```

### Pre-Money SAFE (Legacy)

A pre-money SAFE calculated ownership based on the valuation **before** the SAFE investment, making dilution less predictable for founders.

**Why post-money became standard**: Y Combinator switched to post-money SAFEs because they provide clarity and fairness. Founders can now calculate exactly how much of their company they're giving away, even before the next priced round happens.

## Key SAFE Terms You Need to Know

### Valuation Cap

The **valuation cap** sets the maximum company valuation at which the SAFE will convert to equity. This protects investors if your company's valuation increases significantly before the next round.

**Example**: You raise money on a SAFE with a $5 million cap. Later, you raise a Series A at a $20 million valuation. The SAFE investors convert at the $5 million cap, giving them more equity than Series A investors for the same dollar amount.

### Discount Rate

Some SAFEs include a **discount** (typically 10-25%) that gives investors a reduced price per share compared to the next round's investors. This rewards early risk-taking.

**Example**: With a 20% discount and a Series A price of $1.00 per share, SAFE investors would convert at $0.80 per share.

### Uncapped SAFE

An **uncapped SAFE** has no valuation cap or discount. This is the most founder-friendly structure because investors convert at whatever valuation the next round sets.

Y Combinator itself uses uncapped SAFEs for the $375,000 portion of its standard $500,000 investment. This demonstrates confidence in the startup's future valuation growth.

### MFN (Most Favored Nation) Provision

The **MFN provision** ensures that if you issue SAFEs with better terms to future investors, earlier investors automatically receive those better terms.

**Example**: You raise $100,000 on an uncapped SAFE with MFN. Later, you raise $200,000 on a SAFE with a $8 million cap. The first investor's SAFE automatically updates to include the $8 million cap.

Y Combinator's standard deal structure includes an uncapped SAFE with MFN for $375,000 of their investment, protecting them if you later raise at a capped valuation.

## SAFE vs Other Fundraising Instruments

### SAFE vs Convertible Note

| Feature | SAFE | Convertible Note |
|---------|------|------------------|
| Legal structure | Equity agreement | Debt instrument |
| Interest rate | None | Yes (typically 5-8%) |
| Maturity date | None | Yes (12-24 months) |
| Complexity | Simple (~5 pages) | Complex (~30 pages) |
| Cost | Low legal fees | Higher legal fees |

**When to use convertible notes**: They may still be preferred in some jurisdictions outside the US where SAFE adoption is limited, or when investors specifically require debt instruments.

### SAFE vs Priced Equity Round

A **priced equity round** (like a Series A) involves setting a specific company valuation and issuing shares immediately.

**Advantages of SAFE**:
- Much faster to close (days vs months)
- Lower legal costs ($1,000-5,000 vs $25,000-50,000)
- No need to determine valuation early
- No board seats or complex governance terms

**When to do a priced round instead**: When you have significant traction (typically >$50K MRR), want to bring on board members, or are raising larger amounts ($2M+) where investors expect full due diligence and traditional terms.

## When to Use a SAFE Agreement

### Ideal Scenarios for SAFEs

**Early-stage fundraising** 💡
- Pre-seed and seed rounds ($100K - $2M)
- You have an MVP or early product but limited revenue
- You want to move quickly without extensive negotiations

**Rolling fundraises**
- You're raising money from multiple angel investors over time
- Each investor can sign the same standard SAFE document
- No need to renegotiate terms with each investor

**Friends and family rounds**
- Simple documents that non-professional investors can understand
- Minimal legal complexity for all parties

**Bootstrapped companies raising first capital**
- You don't want to set a valuation too early
- You're focused on building product, not negotiating investment terms

### When SAFEs Might Not Be the Best Choice

**Large institutional rounds** ($5M+)
- VCs typically want priced equity rounds with board seats and governance rights
- SAFEs are unusual for Series A and beyond

**International jurisdictions**
- Some countries have different legal frameworks where SAFEs aren't recognized
- Check with local counsel about enforceability

**When you need the discipline of a maturity date**
- Convertible notes force a future financing or other liquidity event
- SAFEs can theoretically exist indefinitely without converting

**Investor requirements**
- Some institutional investors have policies requiring debt instruments or immediate equity
- Always understand your investors' constraints

## How SAFEs Work in Practice: The YC Model

Y Combinator's standard investment terms provide a real-world example:

**$500,000 total investment**
- **$125,000 for 7% equity** via a post-money SAFE
- **$375,000 on an uncapped MFN SAFE**

This structure gives YC:
1. A guaranteed minimum ownership stake (7%)
2. Upside potential if the company's valuation grows significantly before the next round
3. Protection via MFN if the company later raises on better terms

For founders, this means:
- Clear dilution for the first portion
- Flexibility on valuation for the larger portion
- Alignment with YC's interests in company growth

```python
# YC investment breakdown
guaranteed_equity_investment = 125_000
guaranteed_equity_percentage = 0.07

uncapped_mfn_investment = 375_000

total_yc_investment = guaranteed_equity_investment + uncapped_mfn_investment
print(f"Total YC investment: ${total_yc_investment:,}")
print(f"Guaranteed ownership: {guaranteed_equity_percentage * 100}%")
print(f"Additional upside via uncapped SAFE: ${uncapped_mfn_investment:,}")
```

## Common Pitfalls and Gotchas

### Dilution Stacking

If you raise multiple SAFEs at different valuation caps, you can create complex dilution scenarios. Each SAFE converts independently, which can lead to unexpected founder dilution.

**Best practice**: Keep track of your cap table and model out conversion scenarios before each new SAFE round.

### Pro Rata Rights

Some SAFEs include **pro rata rights**, giving investors the option to invest more money in future rounds to maintain their ownership percentage. This is common with institutional investors.

Y Combinator exercises pro rata rights to invest in subsequent funding rounds of their portfolio companies.

### Conversion Mechanics

SAFEs convert during a "Equity Financing" event, typically defined as raising more than $1 million in a priced round. Make sure you understand exactly what triggers conversion in your specific SAFE document.

### Shadow Dilution

Even though SAFE holders don't have shares yet, they will in the future. This "shadow dilution" affects your option pool calculations and should be factored into your cap table from day one.
