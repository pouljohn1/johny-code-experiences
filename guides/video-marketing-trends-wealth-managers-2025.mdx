One-sentence summary: Video is now the primary channel for building trust and acquiring high-value clients for wealth managers in 2025. 😊

This guide explains why video matters for wealth management, the major trends shaping 2025, and a practical, step-by-step plan to start a compliant, high-impact video strategy today.

## Overview
What you'll learn and prerequisites:
- What learners will achieve: a clear, actionable video strategy tailored for wealth managers.
- Prerequisites: basic knowledge of your firm's compliance rules and a willingness to test short, consistent video content.

## Core Concepts
A quick tour of the most important ideas.

- **Video builds trust** faster than static content by showing the person behind the portfolio.
- **Authentic storytelling** connects emotionally — share your why, client successes (with consent), and behind-the-scenes moments.
- **Educational content** positions you as a thought leader and simplifies complex topics.
- **Personalization** (one-to-one video messages) improves retention and client satisfaction.
- **Compliance-first short-form** content (30–60s) captures attention while staying audit-ready.
- **AI-powered tools** speed production: auto-captions, templates, and analytics.
- **Platform strategy** matters: LinkedIn for authority, YouTube for evergreen education, TikTok/Reels to reach younger investors.

### Small examples
- 60-second TikTok: Quick explainer of a market term with plain language.
- LinkedIn video: 2–4 minute weekly insight on a current market event.
- Personalized client video: A 90-second portfolio update with a clear CTA.

## Step-by-Step: Start a Future‑Proof Video Strategy
Follow these steps to move from idea to measurable results.

1. Define your narrative (1–2 sentences). Align it with brand values and client needs.
2. Pick primary platforms (start with 1–2): LinkedIn + YouTube or LinkedIn + Reels.
3. Create a content calendar (4–8 posts/month): mix educational, storytelling, and personal updates.
4. Build compliance guardrails:
   - Use pre-approved scripts or templates
   - Add disclaimers and store final versions for audits
5. Produce minimally polished videos: good lighting, clear audio, concise scripting.
6. Distribute and promote: native uploads + short clips for other channels.
7. Measure and iterate: track engagement, watch time, leads, and referrals.

### Quick production checklist
- Script approved (yes/no)
- Disclaimers included
- Captions generated
- Thumbnail created
- Platform-specific formatting (aspect ratio)

## Examples: Sample Scripts & Formats
Short sample script for a 60–90 second client update (use as a template):

```text
Hi, I'm [Name], Senior Wealth Manager at [Firm]. Quick update: the market moved because of [one-line cause]. Here's what that means for you: [one-line impact]. We're watching X and plan to do Y. If you have questions, reply or book 15 minutes here. Thanks — talk soon.
```

Platform-specific ideas:
- LinkedIn (2–4 min): Explain recent policy or interest rate change + firm perspective.
- YouTube (6–12 min): Deep-dive educational series (playlists: Market Updates, Retirement Basics).
- TikTok/Reels (30–60s): Bite-sized finance tips and myth-busting.

## Measuring ROI: What to track
Focus on metrics that connect to business outcomes:
- Engagement rate and average watch time
- Lead conversion rate from video viewers
- New client meetings and referral growth
- Retention signals (repeat views, follow-ups)

Tools to consider: Wistia, Vidyard, native YouTube Analytics, and your CRM for tracking conversions.

### Using analytics to refine content
- Identify top-performing topics and hooks.
- Adjust length and format based on average watch time.
- A/B test thumbnails, hooks, and CTAs while keeping all versions compliant.

## Common Pitfalls (and how to avoid them)
- Overproducing: polished videos are good, but perfect can delay consistency. Start simple and iterate.
- Ignoring compliance: always use approved scripts and archive final videos.
- One-size-fits-all content: tailor format and tone to each platform.
- No measurement: track a few KPIs from the start and review monthly.
