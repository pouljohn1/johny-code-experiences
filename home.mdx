Hi! Iâ€™m Poul, a passionate developer who loves exploring new technologies and building apps that people truly enjoy using. This blog is my digital notebook â€” a place where I share my learning journey, the tools and tech stack I work with, and insights into how I approach software development.Whether you're a fellow developer or just curious about how great apps are made, I hope you find something useful or inspiring here. Let's learn and grow together!
