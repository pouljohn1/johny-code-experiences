## Why video marketing matters for wealth managers

Affluent clients want transparency, competence, and a human connection before trusting an advisor. Video helps you show both expertise and personality faster than written content.

Key benefits:

- Video builds trust faster than static content
- It humanizes advisors and shows approachability
- Short and long formats reach different audience segments

## Core concepts

### Authentic storytelling

- *Why it works:* People connect with stories and motivations more than product lists.
- *How to use it:* Share behind‑the‑scenes moments, team introductions, or client success stories (with consent).
- Result: stronger emotional resonance and credibility.

### Educational content as thought leadership

- Make complex ideas simple with clear visuals and plain language.
- Use explainer clips, market commentaries, and short webinars to show expertise.
- Keep episodes consistent (e.g., weekly or monthly).

### Personalization & one‑to‑one video

- Use CRM data to send short, personalized video updates (birthdays, portfolio milestones).
- These clips increase retention and make clients feel valued.

### Compliance‑first short‑form content

- Short videos (30–60s) are great for reach but require pre‑approved scripts and clear disclaimers.
- Keep recorded versions and approvals for audits.

### AI for production & insights

- AI helps with captioning, branded templates, and engagement analytics.
- Use tools to speed editing and measure what topics perform best.

## Best platforms and use cases

- LinkedIn — professional authority, weekly thought leadership
- YouTube — evergreen educational library, playlists for topics
- TikTok / Reels — reach younger investors with short explainers

Choose platforms based on goals: credibility (LinkedIn), discovery and SEO (YouTube), and generational reach (TikTok).

## Measuring ROI from video campaigns

Track these core metrics:

- Engagement rate and average watch time
- Lead conversion rate from video views
- Client retention and referral growth tied to video touchpoints

Use analytics tools (YouTube Analytics, Wistia, Vidyard) to learn who watches and how long. Adjust topics, length, and CTAs based on data.

---

## A/B testing safely

- Test thumbnails, hooks, and calls‑to‑action.
- Ensure every variant is reviewed for compliance.
- Use small experiments to increase performance without regulatory risk.

---

## Step‑by‑step: Start a future‑proof video strategy

1. Define your narrative and brand values.
2. Create a content plan (topics, formats, cadence).
3. Draft scripts and get compliance pre‑approval for templates.
4. Record simple videos (smartphone + good lighting + clear mic).
5. Post consistently and measure results weekly/monthly.
6. Iterate based on analytics and client feedback.

## Quick examples and templates

A simple 30–60 second video structure (use this as a script template):

```text
Hook (0–5s): "Worried about rising rates? Here's one clear step you can take."
Value (5–40s): 2–3 concrete points or a quick explanation.
CTA (40–60s): "Want a short portfolio check? Schedule 15 minutes — link in profile."
Disclaimer (text + voice, brief): "This is educational and not investment advice."
```

Three content ideas you can record this week:

- Market snapshot: 60s summary of last quarter and one action item
- Explainer: "What rising rates mean for retirees" (2 minutes)
- Personalized update: Short recorded message for VIP clients after major events

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

- Skipping compliance review → Always use pre‑approved scripts and store versions.
